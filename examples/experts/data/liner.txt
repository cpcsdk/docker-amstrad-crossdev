Hi! This first  
ReSeT Party is a
success. I want 
to congratulate 
all the people  
who produced an 
entry for the   
compos which    
must be         
considered as a 
springboard for 
something       
bigger. Also a  
big thanks to   
Beb and Toms for
the efficient   
they published  
to promote the  
party. See you  
soon in Outer   
World Music     
another entry   
for the demo    
contest...

After a short   
and noisy road  
trip  we arrived
to a great      
meeting with the
company of      
experts! Some   
nice productions
very pretty     
things to come..
We will come    
back next year !

After 10 years  
of outdoor      
activities      
Krusty decided  
to release this 
old fashioned   
production.     
Well done guy!!!
We hope that    
Overlanders will
do the same with
Point Barres    
or Seed Vicious?
It was a real   
pleasure doing  
these graphics!!
Thanks.         
And the Reset   
Party was       
aweeeeeesome !!!

Back from the   
ReSeT party  0  
washed and      
rested  I must  
say that the    
annual          
Benediction     
meeting is each 
year better!    
There were a lot
of things to do 
and people to   
meet  thus I    
wasn t very     
productive... I 
try to continue 
my CRTC         
experiments the 
first day  but: 
the room.corner 
dedicated to the
others computers
was too         
attractive then 
I watch a lot of
Commodore 64    
Atari ST  and ZX
Spectrum demos  
instead of      
coding! These   
computers are   
now very easy to
use with their  
different disc  
emulators. But  
CPC was of      
course at the   
center of this  
event! It was   
cool to see     
newcomers like  
Fano  or people 
back in meetings
like Krusty the 
hyperactive     
Benediction     
coder .exploited
by Eliot  the   
well know BND   
chairman.. It s 
time for me to  
leave you with  
.Les Experts .  
Coutances.      
because a       
persistent rumor
says that       
someone killed  
the CPC scene   
so I let them   
investigate this
question... But 
put your mind at
rest  as usual  
in these series 
there is a      
turnaround: all 
ends well and   
the accuser     
turns           
ridiculous...   
See you at Reset
x08!

Quel plaisir de 
se laver dans la
meme douche que 
Tom et Jerry !

I had to cancel 
my trip to      
Coutances due to
personnal       
reasons at the  
very last       
minutes but  if 
you want  i can 
give you some   
details about my
participation:  
The original gfx
of the bulldog  
was found on the
net .owner ???..
in a first time 
I have modified 
it on PC using a
macro under     
photofiltre.    
Then i used     
convimg from    
Demoniak to     
convert the gfx 
to CPC plus     
mode 0 format.I 
started rework  
on PC using the 
editor fonction 
of convimg.     
Finally  I      
continued the   
job on CPC plus 
under GOS .from 
Iron..          
Unfortunately   
the gfx should  
have been       
finished at the 
meeting but a   
sad personnal   
reason obliged  
me to cancel my 
trip to         
Coutances...    
nevertheless    
i think most of 
you will enjoyed
it.             
Hope to see all 
of you at the   
next one!!

Grim on the     
keyboard. It was
a long trip to  
go there .in the
Mordor. but it  
was definitely  
worth it! All   
thumbs up! I    
will be back!   
nb: I m still   
not sure what   
Eliot was doing 
with his butter 
in the middle of
the night...    
creepy :P

Just a quick    
note to say that
this meeting was
very friendly   
and it s all    
because barjack 
does not allow  
me more than two
sentences  and I
just finished   
the first. So   
thanx to Eliot  
and Elodie to   
once again      
organize a pure 
CPC based       
meeting.        
Shap:Ovl signing
off.            
                
Pfff: comme     
toujours les    
meetings d Eliot
sont trop bien  
organises...Rien
a y redire...   
C est pas bon   
pour la scene

meme pas raler  
qu ils sont pas 
a 50Hz !

the stewards in 
charge of       
maintaining     
order were      
beyond reproach.

RST0 was a very 
cool CPC party. 
I met some guys 
I have not seen 
since some years
and watched some
cool demos on   
the wrong       
machines!       
Sadly  Not      
enough coders   
participated in 
the different   
programming     
contests. What a
shame for the   
CPC scene!!!!!!!
Nice two see the
other demo      
competitors     
selling their   
futur outdated  
productions :P
